# bandcampmastoshare
An extension to share bandcamp links with band name, album name (or track)  and the tags.

The extension icon will show a blue (aqua) icon when sharing is available and a grey when not. When clicking the icon on a correct page (bandcamp album or track) it will ask for a mastodon instance (server) and will create a post containing Band name, album or track and the tags from the bandcamp page.
